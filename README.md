I am going to make notes of all the technologies that I have learned throughout my life on platforms such as: Platzi, Coursera, Udemy, several universities and obviously YouTube.
This to keep my notes more organized in addition to reviewing everything learned.

You can take all the knowledge from these notes to learn and improve in the technologies you want.

Good Lucky 😁✌️
